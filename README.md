Formal Methods Final Project.

Game theory provides a paradigm through which we can study the evolving communication and phenomena that occur via rational agent interaction \cite{phd10-Umm}. In this work, we design a model framework and explore The Volunteer's Dilemma with the goals of 1) modeling it as a stochastic concurrent multiplayer game, 2) constructing properties to verify model correctness and reachability, 3) constructing strategy synthesis graphs to understand how the game is iteratively stepped through most optimally and 4)analyzing a series of parameters to understand correlations with expected local and global rewards over a finite time horizon.
